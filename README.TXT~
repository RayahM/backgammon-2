VERSION or DATE: 2011 Sep 26

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:

USER INSTRUCTIONS:
Roll the dice, then click a column that you want to move from. The possible legal moves
will get little buttons beneath them and you can press them to choose which your move.

Backgammon Rules:
You have to clear all your pieces off the bar before you may do anything else, so 
there is no way to have both black and white pieces on the bar.(right?)
